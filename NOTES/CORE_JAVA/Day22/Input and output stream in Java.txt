INPUT AND OUTPUT STREAM IN JAVA:


Java I/O is used to process the input and produce the output.

Java uses the concept of a stream to make I/O operation fast. The java.io package contains all the classes required for input and output operations.

We can perform file handling in java by java I/O API.

STREAM:

A stream is a sequence of data. In java, a stream is composed of bytes.

In java, 3 Streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the
console.

1. System.out : standard output stream.
2. System.in : Standard Input  Stream.
3. System.err : Standard error stream.

Let's see the code to print output and an error message to the console 

1] System.out.println("simple message");
2] System.err.println("error message" );

the explanation of OutputStream and InputStream classes are given below:

OutputStream:

Java applications uses an output stream to write data to a destination; it may be a file, an array,
peripheral device or socket.

InputStream:

Java application uses an input stream to read data from a source; it may be a file, an array, 
peripheral device or socket.
