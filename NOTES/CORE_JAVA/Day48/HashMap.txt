HashMap:

- A HashMap is class which implements the map interface.

- It stores values based on key.

- It has 16 size and internally it will increase the size by double, so new size will be 32, 64, 128.

- It is unordered, which means that the key must be unique.

- It may have null key- null value.

- For adding elements in HashMap we use the put method.

- Return type of put method is object.

Example:

HashMap hashMap = new HashMap();
hashMap.put(10,"maker");
