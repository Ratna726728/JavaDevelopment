How Program works internally?

Java works on both principle of compiling and interpretation if your using IDE. If your using only notepad then it works on compiling.

Compilation :

When we compile Java program using javac tool, the Java compiler converts the source code into byte code.

Java code(.java) ----> compiler ----> Byte Code(.class)

What Happens at runtime?

Step1: Source code (.java file) creation
Step2: Loading source code into classloader
Step3: Bytecode Verifier
Step4: Interpreter
Step5: Runtime
Step6: Hardware

Source code creation:  The java code which we write in IDE or in some other editor. Source code is having .java extension.

Classloader: It is the subsystem of JVM that is used to load class files.

Bytecode Verifier: Checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.

Interpreter: Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.
