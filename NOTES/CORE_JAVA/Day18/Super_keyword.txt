SUPER KEYWORD:


It is used to refer immediate parent class variables, method and constructor.

Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super 
reference variable.

Why we use Super keyword?

Scenario 1: We are calling the x variable of parent class for that purpose we loading the whole class that is not good 
programmer approach. For user of single variable, we should go for super keyword in  java.

Scenario 2: We are trying to print the x variable of immediate super class by using the super keyword that is the best 
approach because we are not wasting the memory here.

Let's see an example for this:

public class Parent{
	int x = 20;
}

public class Child extends Parent{

	int x = 25;
	public void test(){
		int x = 30;

		//scenario -1
		Parent p = new Parent();
		System.out.println("parent class x Variable="+p.x);

		//scenario -2
		System.out.println("Immediate super class of child class x variable=" + super.x);
	}
}

public class TestMain{
	public static void main(String[] args){

		Child c = new Child();
		c.test();
	}
}

OUTPUT:
parent class x Variable=20
Immediate super class of child class x variable=20
