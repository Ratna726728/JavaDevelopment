Industry level approach for writing Method and constructor chaining:

Method:

In industry, No one use float and integer return type as method even void and string  are 
very rarely used in now a days.

The most preferable way is return object to method or value from object in java.

In industry, how the method looks like as below-

package com.test;
public class Employee{
	public Employee addEmployee(){
		//here you need to return the employee class object.
	}
}


Constructor Chaining:

A constructor is called from another constructor in the same class this process is known 
as constructor chaining.

It occurs through inheritance.

When we create an instance of a derived class, all the constructors of the inherited class
(base class) are first invoked, after that the constructor of the calling class
(derived  class) is invoked.

#Rules for constructor chaining-
1. An expression that uses this keyword must be the first line of the constructor.

2. Order does not matter in constructor chaining.

3. There must exist at least one constructor that does not use this keyword.

#How to achieve constructor chaining?
1. Within the same class-

If the constructors belong to the same class, we use this keyword.

2. From the base class and derived class-

If the constructor belongs to different classes (parent and child classes), we use the 
super keyword to call the constructor from the base class.
