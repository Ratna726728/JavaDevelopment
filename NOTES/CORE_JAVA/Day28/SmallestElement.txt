Program to finding the smallest element in an array.

code>>(NOTES/Codes/Day28/src/com/arraypractice/SmallestElement.java)

EXPLANATION:

In the above mentioned code we have given an array arr[]. and this arr[] is of int data type means
the values present in the array are integers.
int arr[]={10,83,07,45,32,01};

1. Declaring, instantiating and initialize the array arr[].
2. Setting a variable element and initialize it with the value of index 0 i.e. 10.
3. In a for loop setting int i =0 and range is upto the size of array, and incremented the value of i.
4. In for loop we have if conditional statement which is checking the array of index i is lesser than 
   variable element which we setted before.
5. and if the condition gets true then it enters in conditional block.
6. in conditional block we set the element variable again to the specific index of the array.
7. When we found the element then we print it using println.

IMPLEMENTATION:

int arr[] = {10,83,07,45,32,01};
size of array is==> arr.lenght ==> 06

index = value
0th   = 10
1st   = 83
2nd   = 07
3rd   = 45
4th   = 32
5th   = 01


now setting int element = arr[0];
==> element = 10

now iteration part:
we know that element =10, arr.length =6 
we setted the for loop as it should always be less than 6 means it can get to 5th index

1. i=0, element=10
arr[i] < element ==> arr[0] < element ==> 10 < 10 == false

2. i=1,element=10
arr[i] < element ==> arr[1] < element ==> 83 < 10 == false

3. i=2,element =83
arr[i] < element ==> arr[2] < element ==> 7 < 10 == true
will enter in conditional block
setting element as 7

4. i=3,element =7
arr[i] < element ==> arr[3] < element ==> 45 > 7 == false

5. i=4, element =7
arr[i] < element ==> arr[4] < element ==> 32 < 7 == false

6. i=5, element =7
arr[i] < element ==> arr[5] < element ==> 1 < 7 == true
will enter in conditional block
setting element as 1

Element = 1

it will not get i=6 as contion setted as i<arr.length i.e i<6 do false

it will breakout from loop and print the element.
