- If we want to represent group of individual objects as single entity then we shold go for 
collection.

- Collection interface defines the most common method which are applicable for any collection
object.

- In general, collection interface is considered as root interface of collection framework.

- NOTE: there is no concreate class which implements collection interface directly.
(CONCREATE CLASS: 
In Java, a concrete class is one that can be instantiated to produce objects. All of its 
methods, including abstract ones inherited from superclasses or interfaces, have full 
implementations provided by this class. A concrete class is one that has all of its abstract 
methods implemented, to put it another way.)
