SET:

- Set is a interface.
- It is child of collection.
- It is present in java.util package.
- If we want to represent group of individual objects as single entity where duplicates are not allowed
and insertion order is preserved then we should go for set.
- We can store at most one null value in Set. 
- Set is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
- Set can be instantiated as:

Set<data-type> s1 = new HashSet<data-type>();  
Set<data-type> s2 = new LinkedHashSet<data-type>();  
Set<data-type> s3 = new TreeSet<data-type>();
