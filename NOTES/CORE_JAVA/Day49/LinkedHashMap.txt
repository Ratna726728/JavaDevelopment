LinkedHashMap:

- Present in java.util package.

- LinkedHashMap is a class which extends HashMap and implements Map interface.
public class LinkedHashMap<K,V>
    extends HashMap<K,V>
    implements Map<K,V>{}
where K= key and V = value.

- A LinkedHashMap is a hashtable and linked list implementation of the map interface with predictable iteration order.

- It is the same as HashMap except it maintains an insertion order i.e. ordered.

- see the coding example in code directory.
