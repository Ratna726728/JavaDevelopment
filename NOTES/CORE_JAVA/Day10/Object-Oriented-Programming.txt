Object Oriented Programming:

OOPs stands for Object Oriented Programming system.

Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program 
using classes and objects.

Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc.

It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance
5. Polymorphism
6. Abstraction



1. Class:

Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.

A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. 
Class doesn't consume any space.



2. Object:

Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.

An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes 
up some space in memory.

Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only 
necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.


Let's understand the remaining topics in detail.
