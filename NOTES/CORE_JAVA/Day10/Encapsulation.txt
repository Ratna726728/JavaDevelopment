Encapsulation:

The binding of data into a single entity called as Encapsulation.

For Example, class is entity which contains variables and methods.

class Employee{
	int id;
	int salary;
	void x1(){
	}
}

Here Employee class is entity and id, salary, x1() is data.

For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.

A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class 
because all the data members are private here.

# Right Hand rule for encapsulation is, Always keeps global variables private and allows 
other to assign values through public methods.


## Real time Example!!!!!

Suppose you have an account in the bank account. If your balance variable is declared as a 
public variable in the bank software, your account balance will be known as public. 
In this case, anyone can know your account balance. So, is it correct approach? Answer is NO.

So, They declare balance variable as private for making your account safe, so that anyone cannot
see your account balance.

The person who has to see his account balance, will have to access only private members through 
public methods defined inside that class.

Thus, we can achieve security by utilizing the concept of data hiding. 
This is called Encapsulation in java.
