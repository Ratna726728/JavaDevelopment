Data Types


Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable.

There are two types of data types in Java:
1. Primitive’s data types
2. Non-primitive’s data types

1] Primitive Data Type

In Java language, primitive data types are the building blocks of data manipulation.

Primitive data types are having its memory size fixed.

They start with lower case.

Primitive data types are keywords.

Below is the list of primitive Data types:
1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. float
6. double
7. boolean
8. char


1. byte: 
It store the number range from -128 to 127.
It has default size is 1 byte and default value is 0. 


2. short: 
It stores the number range from -32768 to 32767.
It has default size is 2 byte and default value is 0.

 
3. int:
It stores the number range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. 
It has default size is 4 byte and default value is 0.


4. long:
It stores the number range from - 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. 
It has default size is 8 byte and default value is 0.



5.   float: 
It store the number range from 3.4e-038 to 3.4e+038.
It has default size is 4 byte and default value is 0.0 


6.   double: 
It stores the number range from 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308.
It has default size is 8 byte and default value is 0.0

 
7.   boolean:
It stores the value in true or false. 
It has default size is 1 bit and default value is false.


8.    char:
It is used to store the single character. Which is enclosed within single quotes only.  
It has default size is 2 byte.

2. Non-Primitives Data Type

The memory size of non- primitive data type is not fixed.

Non-primitive data type starts with upper case letter.

Non-primitives data types are identifiers.

List of Non- primitive data types:
1. String
2. Array
3. Class
4. Interface
