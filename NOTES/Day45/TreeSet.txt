TreeSet:

1. Underlying data structure is balanced tree.
2. Duplicate objects are not allowed.
3. Insertion order is not preserved.
4. All the objects will be inserted according to some sorting order.
5. Heterogenous objects are not allowed.
6. If we are trying to insert the heterogeneous objects then will get run time exception 
saying ClassCasteException.
7. Null insertion is not allowed, if we try to insert then will get run time exception saying
NullPointerException.

#constructor:

1. TreeSet ts = new TreeSet();
create the empty treeset object where elements will be inserted according to default natural 
sorting order.

2. TreeSet ts = new TreeSet(Comparator c);
Create empty treeset object where elements will be inserted according to customized sorting 
order.

3. TreeSet t = new TreeSet(SortedSet s);

4. TreeSet t = new TreeSet(Collection c);
