program name: program to sort the elements in an array in ascending order.
code>>

Explanation:
1. Declare, instantiate and initialize an array arr[].
2. create a local variable temp and initialize it with 0 value.
3. By using a simple for loop print the original array.
4. use nested for loops for finding the ascending order.
5. First for loop consists a i variable which is starting from 0 and it has limit till
the size or original array.
6. inner for loop consist variable j and it starts with index i+1 and it also goes till 
the size of original array.
7. we have if conditional block which will do comparision between arr[i] index value and 
arr[j] index value. If arr[i] is greater than arr[j] then it will goes inside conditional
block.
8. we will set of temp=arr[i] index value. then arr[i] will set value of arr[j], and
finally arr[j] will set value of temp. temp consist arr[i] value.
9. latstly we will traverse the array and print the new acending order array.
