program to copy all elements of one array into another array.

code>>()

Explaination:

Basically we have to replicate one array into other array. for the very purpose we have taken 2 arrays arr1[] and arr2[].
both the arrays are of int data types. but arr1[] is already initialized and arr2[] is not, so we have to copy elements from
arr1[] and put in the arr2[].

1. Declaring, initializing and instantiate the arr1[] with {1,2,3,4,5} values.
2. Declare an empty array with the same length on arr1[].
     int arr2[]= new int[arr1.length];
3. Create a for loop, which will take the values one by one, and this for loop will continue till arr1.length.
     for(int i =0; i<arr1.length; i++)
4. In for loop body store the elements in arr2 by using i index variable
     arr2[i]= arr1[i];
5. used two more for loop to print the values in arr1[] and arr2[] respectively.

Iterations:

Index = value
0th   =  1
1st   =  2
2nd   =  3 
3rd   =  4
4th   =  5

1] for loop for copying the elements from arr1[] to arr2[].
1. when i =0; and i < 5 = true
arr1[0]= 1
arr2[0]=arr1[0]
arr2[0]=1

2. when i =1; and i < 5 = true
arr1[1]= 2
arr2[1]=arr1[1]
arr2[1]=2

3. when i =2; and i < 5 = true
arr1[2]= 3
arr2[2]=arr1[2]
arr2[2]=3

4. when i =3; and i < 5 = true
arr1[3]= 4
arr2[3]=arr1[3]
arr2[3]= 4

5. when i =4; and i < 5 = true
arr1[4]= 5
arr2[4]=arr1[4]
arr2[4]=5

6. when i =5; and i < 5 = false

2] for loop for printing first array arr1[] elements

3] for loop for printing second array arr2[] elements
