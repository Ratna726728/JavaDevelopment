#Variables:

It is an entity that may vary during the execution of program called as Variable

Variable is  a name which is associated with a value that can be changed.

A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed.
A variable is assigned with a data type.

A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of the 
memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.

There are three types of variables in java:
1. Local Variable
2. Global Variable(Instance Variable)
3. Static Variable


#Guidelines for declaring a variable:


Variable name is the combination of any alphabets, digits and special symbol.

First character in variable name must be alphabets or underscore not digits.

Variable name must be some meaningful words.

No blanks are allowed in variable name.

Variable is declared followed by semi-colon(;).

E.g.

int Student_name;         //allowed
float 5;                  //not allowed
double _a;                //allowed
int a;                    //allowed
int Student Data;         //not allowed
byte Student_5_Guidelines;//allowed


1. Global variable:

It is defined outside of method but inside the class called global variable.

It is called as instance variable.

Declaration and initialization of global variable:

int a;// declaration of global variable
int b=10; // initialization of global variable

E.g.
public class Example{
     int a;
     int b=30;
    public static void main(String args[]){
	Example example = new Example();
	System.out.println(example.b);
     }
}

In above example, we have declared a and b variable globally, outside of the method.

It is initialized automatically by JVM and default value is 0.

Global variables are stored in heap area.

Each instance(Objects) of class has its own  copy of instance variable.

Scope is anywhere in the class.



2. Local Variables:

It is declared inside method body called as local variable.

It is also declared in constructor or block.

E.g.
public class Example{
      public static void main(String args[]){
	int x;
	System.out.println(x);
      }
}
Scope  is within the method, constructor and block only.

Local variable is also declared in constructor.

It does not initialized automatically.

Local variables are stored in stack area.
