Package

Package is nothing but collection of classes and interfaces that works together.

Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package.

There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, util, sql etc.

User-defined package or custom package is the package which is created by user.

Why we use package?

We can easily access the code and use the code anywhere in 
network.(local folder directory network).

Advantages :

1. Reusability â€“ we can place the common code into one folder and reuse it.
2. Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they 
   can be easily maintained.
3. Java package provides access protection.
4. Java package removes naming collision.

Syntax :

package package_name;

Example:
com.amdocs.iciciprudential.insurance.maintenance

Here in above example,
Package are generally starts with the com folder.
amdocs is your company name.
iciciprudential is your client name.
insurance is your project name.
maintenance is your module name

Note: All alphabets are starts with small case letters only.

 
IMPORT:

When we use one class within another class in different packages then go for import statement.

Example- suppose we have two different classes Test and Sample in different packages.
