How MySQL works?

MySQL follows the working of client-server Architecture.

This model is designed for the end-users called clients to access the resources from a central computer known
as a server using network services.

Here, the clients make requests through a graphical user Interface(GUI), and the server will give the desired 
output as soon as the instructions are matched.
