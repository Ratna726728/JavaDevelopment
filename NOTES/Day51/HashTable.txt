HashTable:

- HashTable is a class which implements Map interface and extends Dictionary class.

- It stores values based on key.

- It is unordered and the key should be unique.

- It cannot have null keys or null values. It gives runtime error if we try to add any null
keys or values but will not show an error at compile time.

- It has synchronised methods and slower than HashMap.
