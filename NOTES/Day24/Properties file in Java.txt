PROPERTIES FILE IN JAVA:

Properties file is nothing but simple configuration file called as property file or it is the simple file
with .properties extension and it contain key value formatted data.

It uses java.util.properties package

* why we use properties file?

In standalone or web application, data is frequently changing  is like username, password, etc. So every time
it is very difficult to modify in java that becomes very complex. So to overcome this problem, we should go
for .properties file.

Simple.properties
username=crack
password=pass123

* How to use?
Step 1: Create a method or you can write in main() method too.

public void data(){

}

Step 2: Add a try and catch block in it

try{

}catch(Exception e){

}

Step 3: Inside try block create an object of FileInputStream, with location of properties file. Also, Import 
        the java.io.FileInputStream package.

try{
	FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("location.properties");
}

Step 4: To locate properties create the object of properties in try block and import the  java.util.properties
        package.

Properties p = new Properties();

using load() method take input from FileInputStream object and pass it to object of properties class.

p.load(fileInputStream);

Step 5: Using Object and  getproperty method we will get data from file.

String name = p.getProperty("username");

getProperty method requires key of desired value.

username = Rohit
--------   -----
 key       value


Step 6: Now print the data on console

System.out.println("username = "+name);

Step 7: In catch block write (Exception e)

catch(Exception e){
	e.printStackTrace();
}

Step 8: Inside main() method.

create an object of class.

Sample sample = new Sample();
sample.data();
