Question:


In this problem, you have to add and multiply huge numbers! These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.

Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.

Input Format:

There will be two lines containing two numbers, a and b.

Constraints:

a and b are non-negative integers and can have maximum 200 digits.

Output Format:

Output two lines. The first line should contain a+b, and the second line should contain a*b. 
Don't print any leading zeros.

Sample Input:

1234
20

Sample Output:

1254
24680

Explanation:

1234+20 = 1254.
1234*20 = 24680.

CODE:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        BigInteger firstNumber = scanner.nextBigInteger();
        BigInteger secondNumber = scanner.nextBigInteger();

        BigInteger sum = firstNumber.add(secondNumber);
        BigInteger product = firstNumber.multiply(secondNumber);

        System.out.println(sum);
        System.out.println(product);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
